# LCDproc Web generator

An automated static generator for LCDproc's web content.

# Introduction

This repo contains a node.js-powered static generator for the LCDproc web site.
There's all sorts of bells and whistles involved, including React, react-router,
Stylus, Rebass (for styled components) and plenty more.

# Getting Started

Fortunately, someone interested in updating the web site doesn't need to know
much about these things (beyond the Rebass components reference if fancy
components are desired).

To get started, you just need NodeJS v6.1 or higher and a working Git install.
If `git` and `npm` work on your command line, you're good to go.

1. Clone this repository:

     $ git clone https://github.com/lcdproc/lcdproc-web.git

2. Install dependencies:

     $ npm install
